# 1701QCA Final Project Journal: Lucinda Karikari

This journal documents my continuous development and progress on both Assignments 2 and 3 over 7 weeks. The Journal is split into 2 Phases, with Phase 1 focused on initial ideas, conceptual development and defining the project's ultimate direction. Phase 2 further develops on the former, with more design and concept development, a refined design intent, final prototype, demonstration and reflection on the project as a whole.

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
An interactive children’s toy that responds to light, touch and movement.

### Design Concepts ###
For my initial design concepts, I wanted to explore multiple avenues and different types of operations all-together.

### Design concept 1: Study Buddy ###
A device that allows students or workers to work efficiently with an interval alarm system. It allows the user to work for 30 minutes, then sounds an alarm and informs the user to take a break, and after 5 minutes sounds another alarm, indicating that the user should start working again. The process repeats for no more than 3 hours, then a different alarm sounds, informing the user that they have been studying enough for one sitting. 
The device has two options; Study 30 min : Break 5 min or; Study 60 min : Break 15 min.
Pins 1 and 2 can be pressed to select the setting. The device has to be turned upside down and back upright for the alarm to stop. Buttons A and B are the On and Off buttons. 
It allows people to study at a decent pace, allowing them to have small breaks and doesn’t make them work too hard.

There is an interesting website, Tomato Timer, that allows users to start and stop it whenever they want and also allows them to take either short (5 mins) or long (10 mins) breaks. The design is a lot more sophisticated than my micro:bit version idea, but it shares the same foundational concept.

### Design concept 2: Timely Snacks ###
A snack dispenser that only dispenses every half hour. Similar to the Study Buddy idea, it gives the user an incentive to work towards. It would be most effective with a younger audience in order to teach them about productivity and incentivising. This concept is commonly found in food bowls for pets that dispense a certain amount of food for the animal to eat at a certain time of the day. Instead of using pellet food, candy or chocolate bars would be used for this device.

The timed snack dispenser draws inspiration from machines commonly used for pet cats and dogs. It dispenses the animals’ food at a certain time of day, which is adjustable by the user. The idea makes the device seem trivial, but it could work to help people be more productive with their work.

### Design concept 3: Alarm Box ###
Alarm box: A box that has a specific opening method, and when tried to open the wrong way, sounds an alarm for 10 seconds. The user must open the box in a certain way in order to successfully unlock it and gain access to its contents. Three failed attempts causes the box to lock temporarily for 1 day, disabling the possibility of unlocking it a fourth time. The alarm sound would be produced by a simple buzzer and an LED ‘X’ would flash on the display. The idea stems from the concept behind a simple safe, and a more creative version, a puzzle box. The owner could store any of their private possessions in the box, for example, a journal, spare keys or special items.

![Image](puzzleboxs.jpg)

Puzzle boxes are quite stimulating and I’ve always found them interesting, which is why I considered one for this project. I’ve drawn inspiration from two concepts: A lock and key system, and a more complicated, more creative puzzle system, where the user has to open the box in a very specific way or an alarm will sound and the box will remain locked. This box below is a great example of the idea, but doesn’t have the alarm.

### Final design concept ###
One idea that I was leaning more towards was an interactive toy that could recognise and respond to multiple types of input like light, touch and movement. The idea was to create a creature (similar to a dog or a teddy bear) that seemed to have an ability to change mood, and make certain faces, noises and movements in response to particular input. For example, if someone was to shake the toy, a sad or distressed face would appear on the LED display and a tone or a series of tones would play as well. 
Response to light: If the toy is placed in a dark place it will become distressed and play an alarm-like sound, signalling to its owner to take it to a well-lit area. 
Response to touch: There is a foil band that reaches around the body of the toy, where the user’s hand would be if they were holding it. There are also two other foil pieces, one located on the top of the head and one located on the stomach. If the user has their hand on the band, they can touch one of the other pieces to pat the toy and it will show a happy face and play a playful series of tones.
Response to movement: When the toy is shaken, a distressed face appears on the LED display and a sad series of tones is played. 
All of these characteristics of the device are intended to give the toy a personality and a sense of aliveness, as if it is a real pet with feelings. 
Buttons A and B are the On and Off buttons, respectively.
Another aspect I want to add to the toy is a wagging tail to indicate that the toy is happy. When the user pats the toy, it wags its tail.

After narrowing down my interactive toy idea, I wanted to look online to see if there were some good examples of micro:bit pet toys. Unsurprisingly, there were quite a lot. The pictures below are a little different to my specific idea, but the basic elements are similar and the information provided with the images gives me a good foundation to start from for my own device.

b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

Coding first: I wanted the prototype to have a range of responses to input, so it would be fun to operate. This required quite a bit of coding, as shown below. It didn't take too long to finish this particular code because it consists of mainly the basic processes we learned near the start of the trimester. I tried to include some more complicated coding that I'd sourced off the internet, but none of them worked. I relied a little on the micro:bit booklet instead, and recapped in-class activities I have done in the past.

![Image](code.PNG)

After the code was set up, I could start constructing the prototype around the micro:bit. I ordered alligator clips online specifically for this assessment, but they never arrived, so I had to keep the breadboard included in the design, which makes it a bit chunky.

![Image](interior1.jpg)

The longest part of this whole process was the construction. I used a lot of balsa wood, aluminium foil and pva glue. After a while, I realised that pva glue can take a little while to dry completely and I wasn't very patient with it. I kept trying to work on the prototype and assemble it while the glue was still wet, causing it to fall apart very easily. Eventually I switched it out for super glue, which was much more efficient.

![Image](interior2.jpg)

The inside was also a bit tricky, as I had to keep the micro:bit in a specific position and secure it there, so I had to fiddle around with layering the balsa wood and foil to keep it elevated. 

![Image](sidepiece.jpg)

The little wire piece on the side of the prototype is connected to the ground pin and is where the user must place one of their hands before touching either of the other pins. 

![Image](interior3.jpg)

At this point, the construction was almost complete and I had figured out a way to secure the micro:bit while also being able to move it if I needed to re-program it. I couldn't remove it at this point because all the wires were connected with the prototype's pieces.

## This is the finished prototype ##

The prototype can display different facial expressions to indicate its mood.

I have uploaded a video demonstrating how the prototype works on the Learning@Griffith submission point.

## Design process discussion ##

My first step for this assessment was to look online for interactive art and media projects that I found interesting. After exploring multiple avenues, I narrowed down my choices and established my idea in its most basic form. From there, I worked on the interaction flowchart to figure out how I wanted the device to operate. I had a few ideas as to what it would do (as mentioned in previous sections) and I tried to make them work. Unfortunately, after many rounds of trial and error I could only get one of my multiple ideas to work at a time. Because of this issue, I had to work with a limited amount of options. I made the most of it and tried to make the prototype do as much as it could with its restrictions.
The construction of the physical prototype was a long process that included a couple failed attempts, but overall, it wasn't too hard to do. It was only time-consuming.
There were still two aspects of the design that I couldn't incorporate into the protoype, because I could not figure out the coding for them. I was really hoping for the toy to be able to respond to light, but I wasn't able to have the buzzer and the light sensor working at the same time. 
I also would have liked to make the prototype smaller, and not have had to use the breadboard, but I did not receive my alligator clips in time. Unfortunately, I had to work with what I had but that being said, I think the prototype still turned out nice.

## Next steps ##

Now that I have a working prototype, the next things I will do moving forward are trying to get the light sensor to work, and replacing the large breadboard with alligator clips, which will allow me to make a smaller device and it will also be able to respond to a lot more types of input.
I want to improve the aesthetic of the prototype as well, because balsa wood and aluminium foil don't make the device look very resolved. My hopes for the final outcome are that it will either look like a teddy bear or a unique style character that I design myself. I will do more research and brainstorming on different types of fabrics/materials I can use to make this possible. 
It should also be noted that the micro:bit was very hard to move and could not be removed from the prototype once it was fully constructed. When I make the final outcome, I want the micro:bit to be easily accessible and easily removed.

# Phase 2

## Design Process Discussion ##

My previous prototype took me a little while to make, but I was more focused on the functionality of it than the visual aesthetic. My focuses were on giving the toy more interactive features, trying to make a wagging tail and making the design look appealing to my target audience (children). After receiving feedback on Phase 1, my focus has shifted towards tailoring the entire design around the preferences of my target audience: Babies and toddlers.

I still wanted to incorporate more interactive features in Phase 2 so I ran a few more tests with the device, first constructing it with the buzzer and M-F cables as touch sensors. Just like before, it ran great, but was still fairly simple. I then replaced the buzzer with the motor and changed the code so it would turn on in response to touch. This also ended up working, which was a great indicator that I could make a moving tail. 

Since both these tests were a success, I was feeling optimistic that my plan would work properly. I connected both the buzzer and the motor to the breadboard with them both connected to pin 0. Only the buzzer would work when they were both connected to pin 0, so I reconnected the motor to pin 8. I ended up having the same problems as last time with unsuccessful coding, despite looking at tutorials online. One resource I didn’t utilize as much as I should have was the tutors. I didn’t ask for help with the coding, which ended up being detrimental to me and the assignment.

I thought the best option to make my device look like a children’s toy was to go and buy a real stuffed toy, empty it out and rebuild it with the micro:bit inside it. I bought a couple toys in different sizes and cut them open along the bottom. After removing all the stuffing, I made incisions where I would thread the wires through – one on the back, one on the stomach and one on the right paw. 

The best-looking turnout was a medium sized panda bear plushie. It kept a normal looking form and the stuffing that I had put back inside it acted as a protective shield for the micro:bit, making it less likely to move around or break, and making the toy remain soft.

Here is where the micro:bit and the stuffing are secured inside the bear from. Unfortunately I can't sew and don't have access to outside resources at this time, so I had to make do and secure the bottom with safety pins.

![Image](ass.jpg)

I used the same method as I did for the first prototype with the touch pads. They are connected to the pins with tape and the wires are pushed back inside, securing the pads to the back, front and right paw. 

![Image](pawpad.jpg)
![Image](stomachpad.jpg)

I also had to make a place for the battery wire to go. Because the battery pack doesn’t have any on/off switch, the batteries have to be taken out and put in to turn the device off and on. I decided to have it rest inside the toy, allowing the batteries to be removed and replaced, but not leaving the battery pack exposed to the child.

I decided to keep the led display on despite it being covered, because the light can still be seen through the panda’s face and makes it look like it’s blushing, which I feel is a nice touch for a children’s toy. 
The final product looks cute and is very simple. I actually believe the simplicity works in the toy’s favour, as it is targeted towards very young children. For its demographic, it is fun and engaging, easy to use and uncomplicated. If, however, I was making this for older children, it would need to have more features in order to be more engaging. 

By the end of the making process I had figured out a name for my device: Pablo, the Blushing Panda

## Final Code ##

My final code remains the same as after some failed attempts to make the coding more complex, I reverted to what I knew would work 100%. I dedicated too much time towards outwards experimentation that eventually I was running out of time.

# Reflection 

I’m glad I finished the project to a satisfactory standard but am a little disappointed that I couldn’t further develop the features. Outside issues affected my ability to attend some of the classes but I’m happy I was able to keep on top of my work (somewhat). 

## Functional & Resolved ##

As stated before, my device operates at an ideal standard for a demographic of toddlers and younger children, as it has a few interactive elements (response to touch and response to movement). It works properly and practically, and is more resolved than the first prototype, when visual appeal and the target audience is taken into consideration. 

One part of the bear that isn’t as resolved is the bottom part where the battery is stored. I have no sewing or stitching skills and during this time, no access to a service like this, so the bottom is secured with safety pins. Ideally, there would be Velcro along the lining, making it easy to open and close. However, with the pins in place, it would be very difficult for a child to get it open and potentially get to the batteries, which makes for a slightly safer experience.

## Novelty ##

Unfortunately, the only novelty of the bear is the blushing feature, which is powered by the led lights on the micro:bit. It is a simple, functional design with a small novelty that I believe is effective considering the target audience.

## Robustness ##

The micro:bit is protected by a thick layer of stuffing between itself and the fabric of the bear. Because of this it can be vigorously shaken and nothing will move out of place. It is also very light and easy to hold. It can be pressed on, squeezed, thrown and dropped little to no damage would come to it (still not recommended to be dropped or thrown, though). Overall, the toy is very robust and suitable to be played with by an unruly child.
